If you were to adopt a strict TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach and require all types of tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end), the order of development would involve writing tests first and then writing the code to pass those tests. Hereâ€™s an outline of the development order and process:

### Order of Development in TDD with All Test Types

1. **Define Requirements and Acceptance Criteria**
2. **Write Failing Unit Tests**
3. **Implement Code to Pass Unit Tests**
4. **Write Failing Integration Tests**
5. **Implement Code to Pass Integration Tests**
6. **Write Failing End-to-End Tests**
7. **Implement Code to Pass End-to-End Tests**
8. **Refactor Code**
9. **Repeat**

### Detailed Process

#### 1. Define Requirements and Acceptance Criteria

- **User Story Creation**: Define the user stories, acceptance criteria, and detailed requirements.
- **Break Down User Stories**: Break down user stories into smaller, manageable tasks that can be developed and tested incrementally.

#### 2. Write Failing Unit Tests

- **Identify Units of Work**: Determine the smallest units of functionality to be tested (e.g., functions, classes, methods).
- **Write Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for these small units of functionality. These tests should initially fail because the corresponding code has not been implemented yet.

#### 3. Implement Code to Pass Unit Tests

- **Write Code**: Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the unit tests pass.
- **Run Tests**: Continuously run the unit tests to ensure they pass as you write the code.

#### 4. Write Failing Integration Tests

- **Identify Integration Points**: Determine the integration points between different units or modules that need to be tested together.
- **Write Integration Tests**: Write integration tests that validate the interactions between these units. These tests should initially fail because the integration logic has not been fully implemented yet.

#### 5. Implement Code to Pass Integration Tests

- **Write Code**: Implement the code to handle the integration points between the different units or modules.
- **Run Tests**: Continuously run the integration tests to ensure they pass as you write the code.

#### 6. Write Failing End-to-End Tests

- **Identify End-to-End Scenarios**: Determine the key end-to-end scenarios that need to be tested from a user's perspective.
- **Write End-to-End Tests**: Write end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions and validate the overall functionality of the application. These tests should initially fail because the full functionality has not been implemented yet.

#### 7. Implement Code to Pass End-to-End Tests

- **Write Code**: Implement the code to ensure the application works as expected from an end-to-end perspective.
- **Run Tests**: Continuously run the end-to-end tests to ensure they pass as you write the code.

#### 8. Refactor Code

- **Refactor**: Once all tests are passing, refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability without changing its behavior.
- **Run All Tests**: Ensure all tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) still pass after refactoring.

#### 9. Repeat

- **Iterate**: Continue this process for each new piece of functionality, user story, or bug fix.

### Example Workflow

1. **User Story Creation**:

   - **Story**: As a user, I want to log in to the application so that I can access my dashboard.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: The user should be able to log in with valid credentials and be redirected to the dashboard.

2. **Write Failing Unit Tests**:

   - Write unit tests for the login function, checking for valid and invalid inputs.

3. **Implement Code to Pass Unit Tests**:

   - Implement the login function to pass the unit tests.

4. **Write Failing Integration Tests**:

   - Write integration tests to check the interaction between the login function and the user authentication service.

5. **Implement Code to Pass Integration Tests**:

   - Implement the necessary code to pass the integration tests.

6. **Write Failing End-to-End Tests**:

   - Write end-to-end tests to simulate the user logging in through the UI and being redirected to the dashboard.

7. **Implement Code to Pass End-to-End Tests**:

   - Implement the UI and necessary backend logic to pass the end-to-end tests.

8. **Refactor Code**:

   - Refactor the login function, authentication service, and UI components to improve code quality.
   - Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring.

9. **Repeat**:
   - Move on to the next user story or task and repeat the process.

### Branching Strategy with TDD

Given the strict TDD approach, your branching strategy should reflect the stages of development and testing:

- **Feature Branches**: Create branches for each feature or user story.

  - `feature/NFG-<issue-number>-<short-description>`

- **Development Branch**: Merges into this branch must have passing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

  - `development`

- **Testing Branch**: Optional, to test integration of multiple features before merging into development.

  - `testing`

- **Staging Branch**: For pre-production testing.

  - `staging`

- **Production Branch**: For deployment-ready code.
  - `production`

### Git Hooks and GitHub Actions

#### Git Hooks

Use pre-push and pre-commit hooks to ensure tests are written and passing:

**Pre-Commit Hook**:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Get the current branch name
branch_name=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)

# Define the branch naming pattern
pattern="^(feature|hotfix)/NFG-[0-9]+-[a-z0-9-]+$"

if ! [[ $branch_name =~ $pattern ]]; then
  echo "Branch name '$branch_name' does not follow the naming convention."
  echo "Please use the following convention: 'feature/NFG-<issue-number>-<short-description>' or 'hotfix/NFG-<issue-number>-<short-description>'"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Pre-Push Hook**:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Navigate to the project root directory
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

# Run tests
npm run test

# Check test results
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Tests failed. Please fix the tests before pushing."
  exit 1
fi
```

#### GitHub Actions

Create workflows to enforce tests before merging into development:

**GitHub Actions Workflow**:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - development

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: "16"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm run test:unit

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration

      - name: Run e2e tests
        run: npm run test:e2e

      - name: Verify test coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage
```

### Summary

This approach ensures that all necessary tests are written and passing before code is merged into the development branch, while providing a flexible workflow that can accommodate different testing strategies. By enforcing these practices through Git hooks and GitHub Actions, you maintain high code quality and comprehensive test coverage.
