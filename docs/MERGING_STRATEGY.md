## Environment Setup and Workflow for Nufacturing App

### Merging Strategy

When managing multiple environments (e.g., Development, Testing, Staging, Production) in a software development workflow, the approach to merging can depend on several factors, including the size of the team, the complexity of the project, and the need for stability and control over what changes are promoted. Here are the advantages and considerations for both approaches:

### Merging Entire Environment Branches

#### Advantages:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures that all changes that have been tested together in one environment are promoted together, reducing the risk of integration issues.
2. **Simplicity**: Fewer merge operations and less manual intervention are required, simplifying the process.
3. **Efficiency**: Can be more efficient for large teams or projects with many small changes, as it reduces the overhead of managing multiple merges.

#### Considerations:

1. **Stability**: All changes, including potentially unstable ones, are promoted together. This can be mitigated by thorough testing before merging.
2. **Debugging**: If an issue arises in the next environment, it may be harder to isolate which change caused the problem.

### Merging Each Feature Individually

#### Advantages:

1. **Control**: Provides more granular control over which features are promoted, allowing for selective promotion of stable and high-priority features.
2. **Stability**: Reduces the risk of promoting unstable or incomplete features, as each feature can be thoroughly tested before promotion.
3. **Debugging**: Easier to isolate and resolve issues, as each feature is promoted individually.

#### Considerations:

1. **Complexity**: More complex and time-consuming to manage, as each feature requires individual attention and merge operations.
2. **Integration Issues**: Higher risk of integration issues if not managed carefully, as features developed in isolation may have unforeseen interactions.

### Recommendations

Given the considerations, a hybrid approach is often beneficial:

1. **Development to Testing**: Regularly merge the entire development branch into the testing branch to ensure that all new changes are integrated and tested together. This helps identify integration issues early.
2. **Testing to Staging**: Merge features individually from testing to staging. This allows for selective promotion of stable and high-priority features while providing control over what is being prepared for production.
3. **Staging to Production**: Merge the entire staging branch into production. Since staging should closely mimic the production environment and only contain thoroughly tested features, this ensures a smooth and consistent deployment.

### Practical Steps

1. **Feature Branches**: Develop each feature in its own branch.
2. **Development Environment**: Regularly merge feature branches into the development branch for integration testing.
3. **Testing Environment**: Periodically merge the entire development branch into the testing branch.
4. **Selective Promotion to Staging**: After thorough testing, merge individual stable features from the testing branch into the staging branch.
5. **Production Deployment**: Once all features in staging are verified and stable, merge the entire staging branch into the production branch.

### Example Workflow

1. **Feature Development**:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b NFG-123-your-feature
   # Develop feature
   git commit -m "NFG-833 Add new feature"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Merge into Development**:
   ```sh
   git checkout development
   git merge NFG-123-your-feature
   git push origin development
   ```
3. **Merge Development into Testing**:
   ```sh
   git checkout testing
   git merge development
   git push origin testing
   ```
4. **Promote Feature to Staging**:
   ```sh
   git checkout staging
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-feature>
   git push origin staging
   ```
5. **Merge Staging into Production**:
   ```sh
   git checkout production
   git merge staging
   git push origin production
   ```

This approach balances the need for integration and stability with control over the deployment process, helping ensure a smooth and reliable workflow.
