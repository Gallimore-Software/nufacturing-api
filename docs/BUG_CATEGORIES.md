Categorizing bugs can help in effectively managing and prioritizing them. Here are some common bug categories that can be useful:

### Functional Bugs

1. **UI/UX Bugs**: Issues related to user interface and user experience, such as misalignment, broken buttons, or confusing navigation.
2. **Logic Errors**: Bugs caused by incorrect implementation of business logic or application flow.
3. **Input Validation**: Bugs related to improper validation of user inputs, such as missing required fields or incorrect data types.
4. **Data Processing**: Issues with data calculations, data storage, or data retrieval.
5. **Integration Bugs**: Problems occurring due to incorrect integration between different modules or external systems.

### Non-Functional Bugs

1. **Performance Issues**: Problems that affect the speed, responsiveness, or stability of the application.
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Bugs that expose the application to security risks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or improper authentication.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: Bugs related to incompatibility with different browsers, operating systems, or devices.
4. **Accessibility Bugs**: Issues that affect the accessibility of the application for users with disabilities.

### Environmental Bugs

1. **Environment Configuration**: Issues arising from incorrect environment setup, such as missing configurations or incorrect dependencies.
2. **Deployment Bugs**: Problems that occur during or after deployment, such as deployment scripts failing or services not starting correctly.

### Regression Bugs

1. **Regression Bugs**: Issues that were previously fixed but have reappeared after new changes or updates.
2. **Broken Fixes**: Bugs introduced by a recent fix or patch, causing new issues in the application.

### Data-Related Bugs

1. **Data Corruption**: Issues where data is incorrectly stored, retrieved, or displayed.
2. **Data Integrity**: Bugs affecting the consistency and accuracy of data within the application.

### Workflow and Process Bugs

1. **Workflow Interruptions**: Bugs that disrupt the normal workflow or process within the application.
2. **Process Logic**: Issues related to incorrect or incomplete implementation of workflows or processes.

### Documentation Bugs

1. **Missing Documentation**: Absence of necessary documentation for features, APIs, or components.
2. **Incorrect Documentation**: Documentation that is outdated, incorrect, or misleading.

### Edge Case Bugs

1. **Boundary Conditions**: Issues that occur when inputs or actions are at the extreme ends of expected ranges.
2. **Rare Scenarios**: Bugs that appear only under rare or unusual circumstances.

### Miscellaneous Bugs

1. **Third-Party Issues**: Bugs caused by third-party libraries or services.
2. **User Errors**: Issues arising from user mistakes or misunderstandings, often due to unclear instructions or feedback.
